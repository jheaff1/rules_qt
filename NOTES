resolve TODOs

have requirements.txt in rules_qt repo, not e2e, and call the pip repo rules_qt_pip

replacement of "-config" files breaks llvm-config, see https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_foreign_cc/pull/109. commit bf2cb01
llvm-config --ldflags will refer to an old sandbox. This was solved for libpng and freetype by replacing the -config file, but they were ascii scripts, not executables! could use it if no-sandbox for llvm build, but try mesa without llvm-config

could try to change replace_in_files to only do so if "file <file>" result contains "ascii"

Add the following to Bazel rc and use Bazel 6.0 to see if it prevents llvm being built twice - https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/14023#issuecomment-1325718022

See if qt cmake variable can be set to not build the docs and therefore not require llvm
